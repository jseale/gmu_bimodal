    "#### Abstract\n",
    "This research implements transfer learning in text classification for the MM-IMDB movie genre prediction task, set forth by Arevalo et al. (2017). Using the ULMFiT methodology (Howard and Ruder 2018) on the wikitext-103 English language model (an AWD-LSTM developed by Merity et al. 2017, and implemented by Howard and Ruder 2018) with the MM-IMDB title and plot summary data, and genre classifications (Arevelo et al. 2017), an Fbeta score of 74.1 is obtained, outperforming Arevelo et al.'s (2017) micro F score of 63.0, and Keila et al.'s (p.c., 2018) micro F score of 62.3, the highest scores obtained with image and text model fusion, which outranked solely text, and solely image model performance at the time."

    "## II. Literature review\n",
    "In Arevelo et al. (2017) uni- and bi-modal genre classification experiments on images (movie posters) and text (movie plots) in the MM-IMDb dataset are performed and it is found that bimodal classifiers, acting on inherently bimodal resources (movies represented by plot summaries and posters), outperform unimodal models which take as input either the text or the images. Their best performance on the MM-IMDb task is a 63.0 micro F-measure score, achieved with a gated multimodal unit (GMU)—it is also the highest recorded score on this task in the literature reviewed herein, and attested to in Keila et al. (2018) and Weisen and HaKoen-Kerner (2018). _The micro F-measure is used as it accounts for label imbalance within the training set. It's calculated using raw counts of true positives, false negatives and false positives, as opposed to per-category F1 averages (Pedregosa et al. 2011)._\n",
    "\n",
    "The gating in Arevalo et al.'s GMU learns which features from text and image submodules input aid most in the classification task. To determine which text representation submodule to use in their GMU, they evaluate a n-gram model (following Kanaris & Stamatatos 2009), a word2vec model (following Mikolov et al. 2013), and two RNN models (one which takes word2vec embeddings as inputs, and another that learns word vectors from randomly initialized parameters). They find their best scoring text submodule to be the RNN with word2vec embeddings, which they call the MaxoutMLP_w2v, and use in their high scoring GMU. To evaluate and choose this text module they compare performance against Kanaris and Stamatatos' (2009) character-based n-gram models on the KI-04 dataset and the 7genre, multi-class, single-label datasets. They record the MaxoutMLP_w2v achieves _state-of-the-art_ results on the KI-04, and outperforms Kanaris and Stamatatos' F1 of 84.1 with an 85.4 on the 7genre dataset. On the multi-label MM-IMDb text data classification task, their MaxoutMLP_w2v performs with an 59.5 micro F1. The MM-IMDb text they use consists of movie plots that average 92.5 words, and have, on average 2.48 associated genres. Their worst scoring text classification module on the MM-IMDb movie plot dataset is the RNN that learned from scratch, achieving a 49 micro F1, which they attribute to the lack of training data used compared to that used in the development of the word2vec embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kiela et al.'s (2018) research provides accuracy scores for a number of different models on the MM-IMDb task, and also concludes that multimodal models outperform unimodal models on the task. Their work, in conjunction with Arevalo et al. (2017), provides the baseline for this study, in which a unimodal text classifier outperforms the top performing multimodal, and unimodal models in their studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy (micro F1, Kiela, p.c.) for Kiela et al.'s (2018) fastText model (providing a baseline as a text-only unimodal model) is recorded at 58.8 ± 0.1. The fastText classifier treats input texts as embedded bag of n-gram features that are then averaged into a hidden layer and fed to linear classifier with hierarchical softmax activation over the classes (Joulin et al. 2016). Accuracy on the MM-IMDb task for their continuous, non-discretized bimodal models, which incorporate the fastText model for language representation, goes from 61.0 ± 0.0 to 62.3 ± 0.2 (averaged over five runs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Genre prediction on other, similar, text-only, IMDb datasets has been performed, all with accuracy results that are outperformed by the text classifier developed in this research. Hoang (2018) developed the following multilabel classifiers, reported here with their F-scores, over the plot summaries of 250,000 IMDb movies: a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, trained with CBOW features had an F1 of 53.0, his XGBoost classifier, using word2vec features as inputs, 49.0, and a Multinomial Gated Recurrent Unit had a 56.0. Nyberg's (2018) K-nearest neigbors movie genre classifier, acting over movie review text for IMDb movies, outperformed a neural net with tf-idf as input with an accuracy score of 55.4. Ho (2011) compared four movie genre classification methods over the IMDb movie plot summaries and genres provided at https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/: a one-v-all SVM, a multilabel K-nearest neighbor (KNN), a parametric mixture model, and a three layer neural net with sigmoid activation function and regularized cost function the input of which consisted of tf-idf vectors mapped to a PCA-dimension-reduced space. Ho records an F measure of 54.9 for his best model, an SVM with L2-regularized L1 loss and a default penalty of one. Kohli (2017) also achieves his best F measure on a multilabel IMDb genre classification task using a SVM with tf-idf input—a 55. His work compares variations of KNNs, SVMs, and logistic regression models. One interesting approach to genre classification incorporates modeling of emotion in plot synopsis, but the highest micro F1 achieved by Kar et al (2018) is a 37.8. \n",
    "\n",
    "The unimodal model in this research reduces the error of these other models by ~15% (compared to Arevalo's 2017 best GMU F score) and more. This is attributed to the transfer learning technique employed in the fine-tuning method developed by Howard and Ruder (2018), _Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification_ (ULMFiT). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification\n",
    "Howard and Ruder (2018) address issues in the initialization of weights in transfer learning for text classification models, in that pre-trained word embeddings such as Mikolov et al.'s (2013) are often treated as fixed parameters and either used in a model's first layer, or are concatenated at different layers (Peters et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018); leaving most of a model's parameters randomly initialized. A more robust initialization of classifier parameters using the transfer of language model (LM) weights proved effective in Dai and Le (2015), but required millions of documents with text from within the classification domain to avoid overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Howard and Ruder (2018) improve upon this idea of finetuning a LM as a classifier by introducing a method they have coined _Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification_ (ULMFiT). In ULMFiT, weights for a general domain language model (a model that predicts the next word in a sentence) are first developed. That language model is then fine-tuned, again as a language model, on text from a domain of interest, and then it is again fine-tuned, finally as a text classifier, for that domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the ULMFiT method incorporates domain-specific training, Howard and Ruder consider it _universal_, because, unlike in Peters et al. (2018), in which custom architectures are used for different tasks, a single architecture and training process can be used across tasks that vary in the number and size of documents, as well as in label types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _wikitext103_ model, used in this research as the general domain model is provided in the fastai library (Howard and others, 2018) and is developed by Merity et al. (2017) over the WikiText-103 dataset, also made available by Merity et al. (2016): this dataset is greater that 110 times the size of the Penn Treebank, and contains over 100 million tokens from full, verified Good and Featured Wikipedia articles with all numbers, punctuation and original case intact. Further discussion of the techniques used to develop the model, and its archicture, are covered in section V.\n",
    "\n",
    "Howard and Ruder describe their fine-tuning techinque as _discriminative_ (Discr) and use what they call _slanted triangular learning rates_ (STLR) in order to retain previously learned, low-level language features while developing higher level, domain- and classification-specific features. Citing Yosinski et al. (2014), that different layers of the net represent different types of language features, with higher level features encoded in the last layers, Howard and Ruder employ different learning rates (LRs) for each of the layers—starting with the largest learning rate on the last layer (the layer representing the highest level of information)—and divide each subsequent layer's learning rate by 2.6 to retain more of the most general data representation in the lower levels. The rational behind using 2.6 as the dividend is that it empirically produces better results. They further manipulate the learning rate this generally decreasing LR by employing their slanted triangular (STLR) technique (a modification on Smith's 2017 triangular LR) which linearly increases the LR for a brief time and then introduces a slow linear decay.\n"

    "#### Text classifier metrics\n",
    "As the classification problem we are facing is a multilabel problem, where each text can have multiple genres, it affects model design and metrics. The model is discussed in the Language Model section and the metrics, here. Performance is scored on two fastai metrics, accuracy_thresh and fbeta.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### accuracy_thresh\n",
    "accuracy_thresh could be considered, the 'accuracy of the model's predictions above a certain threshold', and is computed only when the number of predictions our model makes matches the number of human-applied labels provided in the MM-IMDB dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language classifier model uses a final sigmoid activation function [TO DO: ISOLATE THE SIGMOID FUNCTION IN THE RNN CODE] outputing a confidence score for any of the 26 possible genre labels [TO DO: DETERMINE WHY THE BIAS IS INCLUDED IN THE FINAL RNN LAYER] between 0 and 1—and our model is set to consider anything above a .5 threshold as a match between the predicted and actual labels. Again, for each movie, the accuracy_thresh measure is computed using only the predictions where the number of predicted labels matches the number of applied labels. The average of the accuracy_thresh scores is then computed for the entirety of training dataset and recorded per training epoch. The accuracy_thresh obtained during the final training epoch for the experiment conducted on January 21, 2019 is 93.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### fbeta\n",
    "fbeta is the F1 score computed using the weighted harmonic mean of the model's precision and recall. This is the score compared, in this research, to Arevalo et al. (2017), and Kiela et al.s' (2018) GMU micro F1 scores recorded on the same task, with the same data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the fbeta/F1 score, the beta parameter acts as a weight that promotes either precision or recall in the combined score. A beta over 1 promotes recall, under 1 promotes precision, at 0 considers only precision and as it reaches infinity considers only recall. (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The beta parameter used in the model's fbeta is 2, meaning the metric favors recall slightly over precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Recall_ is defined as the number of true positives over the number of true postives plus false negatives. What does that mean? It means that you're measuring the percent you got right out of all that you should have gotten right. _Precision_ is defined as the number of true positives over the number of true positives plus false positives. What does that mean? It means you're measuring the percent of all the predictions you got right out of the ones you made. _Recall_ can therefore be considered a more stringent metric, and the model's beta parameter favoring recall slightly means that the measurement is a bit stricter than if it favored, or only took into consideration, precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fbeta obtained during the final training epoch for the experiment conducted on January 21, 2019 is 71.0. This means that by employing Howard and Ruder's (2018) ULMFiT method on the WT103_1 English language model (Merity et al. 2017, Howard and Ruder 2018) with the MM-IMDB title and plot summary data, and genre classifications (Arevelo et al. 2017), we already see higher accuracy performance than the fusion models previously employed on the same classification task and data; and the fusion models were outperforming text-only models (Kiela et al. 2018)."

    "The pretrained wikitext-103 model is as Howard an others (2018) puts it, a 'state-of-the-art' NT-AvSGD Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM), initially developed by Merity et al. (2017). The weight dropping technique employed in the AWD-LSTM is a Merity et al. innovation, _DropConnect_, in which the same, recurrent weights are dropped for the entirety of the forward and backward pass—_DropConnect_ isn't used on the non-recurrent weights of the LSTM layers. The averaged stochastic gradient descent (AvSGD) is used to reduce noise—it operates like SGD, until the last iteration when an average of a certain number of previous iterations is returned, rather than the last iteration's solution. A threshold determining the number of iterations to average is, in the AWD-LSTM, is determined during processing via a non-monotonic trigger (NT). The NT serves as a conservative criterion that instigates averaging when a validation perplexity metric fails to improve for multiple cycles (Merity et al. 2017). Perplexity measures how well the model will predict the next word in a sentence, and Merity et al. record state-of-the-art word level perplexities with their AWD-LSTM for two data sets. They achieve a 57.3 on Penn Treebank and a 65.8 on WikiText-2. "

In the same vein of using a more advanced text classifier than that used in Arevalo et al. (2017)  and Kiela et al. (2018), further investigating optimizations for a CNN, such as an implementation of attention, could be investigated.  \n"
